HOW TO USE THE TRACS ASSEMBLER C PROGRAM:

(INPUT) FOR THE ASSEMBLY CODE TO BE PROCESSED BY THE ASSEMBLER:

------	The ASSEMBLY CODE must be saved as a text (.txt) file and placed in the same directory as the C program.
------	The default filename expected by the program is:
			"Team9_SP1_TRACS-ASSY-Source.txt"
------	Alternatively, you can specify a custom input and output filename using the command line:
			./Team9_SP1_TRACS-ASSY <input_file.txt> <output_file.txt>

OUTPUT:

------	Output is generated only if the program runs successfully.
------	During execution, the assembler will print the status and any errors to the console.
------	The assembler performs a line-by-line syntax check. If an error is encountered:
			- It will be printed to the console.
			- The assembler will stop processing further lines.
------	If successful, the machine code will be saved to the specified output file (default: "output.txt").

SYNTAX (Same as TRACS Assembly Language):

For OPCODES requiring OPERAND:
	OPCODE<space><valid operand>

For OPCODES not requiring OPERAND:
	OPCODE

For Line Comments:
	<semicolon ;> line comments

For Preprocessor Directives (limited to ORG only):
	ORG<space><valid address>

------	All OPCODES and preprocessor directives must be written in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
------	Operands may be:
			- Hexadecimal: e.g. "0x012" (max 3 hex digits, i.e., up to 0xFFF)
			- Decimal: e.g. "4095" (max decimal equivalent of 0xFFF)
			- Labels: e.g. "loop:"
------	Labels must end in ':' and appear at the beginning of a line or before an instruction.
------	To add comments, start the comment with a semicolon ';'
------	ORG directive and program counter must not exceed 0x3FF.
------	Each instruction is considered to occupy 2 bytes in memory.
------	Program must include an EOP instruction to mark the end.

SAMPLE USAGE (TERMINAL/COMMAND LINE):

1. Using default filenames:
	./Team9_SP1_TRACS-ASSY

2. Using custom filenames:
	./Team9_SP1_TRACS-ASSY mycode.txt myoutput.txt
